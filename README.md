# Simple Calculator App
## App Description
The Application is meant to be a React+Typescript App that does simple math calculations, similar to the calculator apps present in mobile devices.

## App Tech Stack: Vite - React + TypeScript + ESLint
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Testing - Vitest, React-Testing-Library and Jest
- Using the Vitest test runner with React Testing Library for testing interface components functionality. Using Jest Testing Framework for assertions.

## Linting - ESLint with AirBNB-TS Standard
- This project uses the linter with the AirBnb standard for TypeScript.

## Version Control: GIT, GITHUB, GitFlow
- I am using Git as the version control system with the remote repository stored on GitHub and taking advantage of the GitFlow branching model.
